# Mobile Sales Dashboard (Power BI)

This project is a **Mobile Sales Dashboard** created using **Power BI** as part of a guided practice project. The goal of this dashboard is to analyze mobile phone sales data and derive key business insights through data modeling, transformations, and interactive visualizations.

## Project Overview

This dashboard provides an analytical view of mobile sales performance. It helps in answering key questions such as:

* Which **brands** are performing well?
* What are the **top-selling models**?
* Which **regions** contribute most to sales?
* Monthly and yearly **sales trends**.

The dashboard also includes slicers and filters for better interactivity and deeper analysis.
